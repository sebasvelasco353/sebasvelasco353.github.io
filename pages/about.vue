        <p>Hello, my name is Sebastian Velasco, I'm a front end developer from Cali Colombia who studied
        Interactive Media Design at the Icesi university and fell in love with
        coding, so much I made it my profession and ive been doing this for more than
        three years.</p>
        <p>I'm focused on well written and structured component based
        applications using react or vue, but have experience with other web (front and back end) technologies;
        due to my design and ux roots I have an understanding of the principles needed to create and
        maintain good user interactions and feedback which helps me code with
        the user in mind.</p>
        <p><b>Velas_Code</b> is a project of mine in which i create content about my journey as a developer:
        videos and blogs in which i share what i learn, what i find useful or think should change, this as a way of giving
        back to the community that has helped me grow so much in my journey.</p>
