        <p>Hello, im a front end developer from Cali Colombia, i studied
        Interactive Media Design at the Icesi university and fell in love with
        coding, so much its my profession and ive been doing this for more than
        two years and will continue adding knowledge and practice into the many
        years that will come.</p>
        <p>i am also focused on well written and structured component based
        applications using react, i also have some experience with different web (front and back end) and mobile technologies; due to my design and ux
        roots i have an understanding of the principles needed to create and
        maintain good user interactions and feedback which helps me code with
        the user in mind.</p>
        <p>i also played rugby during my university years which helped me become a
        better team player and to learn to act under pressure.</p>
